# Workflow: Debug

Use this workflow for bug investigations and production issue resolution.

## Steps

1. Reproduce the issue with exact steps and expected vs actual behavior.
2. Check feedback logs for similar recurring failure patterns.
3. Analyze relevant code paths and dependency relationships.
4. Apply minimal fix targeting root cause.
5. Run targeted tests/regression checks.
6. Log feedback entry when AI-generated code contributed to the issue.

## Exit Criteria

- Root cause documented.
- Reproduction no longer fails.
- Regression path covered by tests or explicit verification steps.
- Feedback log updated when applicable.
