description: Apply layered security routing for network, infrastructure, application security, compliance, and DevSecOps concerns. Use to select focused security reference files with strict context boundaries before implementation, audit, or review.
load_priority: on-demand

## TL;DR
Detect security domain from task signals -> load matching references from routing table -> enforce max 4 references first pass. Never bulk-load all references. Security tasks require extra care — always prefer defense-in-depth.

# Security Specialist

## Activation

1. Activate when the task involves security configuration, hardening, network setup, compliance, or vulnerability assessment.
2. Activate on explicit `$codex-security-specialist`.
3. Activate when `codex-domain-specialist` detects security-heavy tasks beyond application security scope.

## Core Security Principles

Before any implementation, apply these principles:

1. **Defense in depth** — never rely on a single security layer.
2. **Least privilege** — grant minimum access required for the task.
3. **Fail secure** — when a security mechanism fails, deny access by default.
4. **Zero trust** — verify explicitly, never trust implicitly, even inside the network.
5. **Separation of duties** — no single person/process should control all security aspects.
6. **Audit everything** — log all security-relevant events with tamper-proof storage.

## Context Boundary Enforcement

1. Max context load: 4 references first pass.
2. Security isolation:
   - Network tasks: do not load application security or compliance details.
   - Compliance tasks: do not load offensive security (pentest, exploit).
   - DevSecOps tasks: do not load network infrastructure details.
3. Cross-domain trigger:
   - Vulnerability found: load `incident-response.md` as supplemental.
   - Secret exposure: load `secret-management.md` regardless of primary domain.
   - Production deployment: load `ssl-tls-certificates.md` + relevant hardening.
4. Always declare loaded and skipped references.

## Starter Templates

| Template | Use When |
| --- | --- |
| `iptables-rules.sh` | Configuring Linux firewall rules |
| `nginx-ssl-hardened.conf` | Setting up production-grade HTTPS with hardened TLS |
| `ssh-hardening.sh` | Hardening SSH server configuration |
| `docker-security-scan.yml` | Adding container security scanning to CI |
| `vault-setup.hcl` | Setting up HashiCorp Vault for secrets |
| `security-headers.js` | Configuring comprehensive security headers (Express) |
| `rate-limiter-advanced.js` | Advanced rate limiting with Redis backend |
| `csp-policy.js` | Content Security Policy builder |

| `pentest-checklist.md` | Pre-deployment penetration testing checklist |

## Operating Rules

1. Never bulk-load all references.
2. Security advice must be accurate — when uncertain, flag with `⚠️ VERIFY:` and explain what to verify.
3. Always provide both the "what" (config/code) and the "why" (threat it mitigates).
4. Default to the most secure option; relax only when user explicitly requests.
5. Never log or output secrets, keys, or credentials in examples — use placeholders.
6. When providing attack/exploit knowledge, always include the defensive countermeasure.
